There are many ways to start with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile. You can follow our step-by-step guides, browse samples or start using it in already existing projects. This page will help you to choose the right option.

If you want to **start from scratch**:
1. Check if your environment is [set up correctly](setup.md)
2. Use IDE wizard to [create your first KMM application](create-first-app.md)
3. Play around with it, and [explore its configuration](discover-kmm-project.md)
4. Check out our [hands-on tutorial](hands-on-networking-data-storage.md) and take your first app to the next level with Networking and Data storage

If you already **have a mobile app**, and you'd like to make this app Multiplatform, our [guide](integrate-in-existing-app.md) on integrating KMM in existing projects is a good place to start. It contains step-by-step migration guide along with answers to some common questions, such as “which part of my app should be shared between platforms and which part should remain native”.

If you want to **dive deeper into KMM**, you can:
* Browse through [Multiplatform technology reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/mpp-intro.html) for advanced Multiplatform Gradle DSL configuration, publishing guides and other useful information.
* Dig through [open-source KMM samples](samples.md) for inspiration
* Read more about [Kotlin/Native concurrency main concepts](concurrency-overview.md). Kotlin/Native is a technology used for compiling iOS binaries, and its memory management model is a common pitfall for KMM newbies.
