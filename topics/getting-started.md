There are many ways to get started with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile. You can follow our step-by-step guides, browse the samples, or start using KMM in your existing projects. 
This page is designed to help you choose what works best for you.

If you want to **start from scratch**:
1. Check whether your environment is [set up correctly](setup.md).
2. Use the IDE wizard to [create your first KMM application](create-first-app.md).
3. Play around with it and [explore its configuration](discover-kmm-project.md).
4. Check out our [hands-on tutorial](hands-on-networking-data-storage.md) and take your first application to the next level with networking and data storage.

If you already **have a mobile application** and want to make it multiplatform, learn how to [integrate KMM in an existing application](integrate-in-existing-app.md). 
You will understand which parts of your application to share and find instructions on how to make your application work well on both iOS and Android.

If you want to **dive deeper into KMM**, you can:
* Dig through the [open-source KMM samples](samples.md) for inspiration.
* Read more about the [main Kotlin/Native concurrency concepts](concurrency-overview.md). Kotlin/Native is a technology used for compiling iOS binaries, and its memory management model is a common pitfall for KMM newbies.
* Browse through the [Kotlin Multiplatform technology documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/mpp-intro.html) for an advanced Multiplatform Gradle DSL configuration guide, publishing instructions, and other useful information.
